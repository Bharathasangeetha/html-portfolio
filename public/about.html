<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi.... </p>

<p>I'm BharathaSangeetha. I'm a Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate. I completed engineering in 2016. I started my career as a copy editor and then moved to a new desigation called production editor. I continued my job as a production editor for 5 years.  Eventhough i loved my job, I always want to be a software engineer so I started to learn coding through youtube. Now i learned JAVA, C#, HTML CSS, javascript and react.js through youtube. </p>
