<h2>My top 3 tamil movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>12B</h3>
<p>I watched this feel good movie in lockdown and i loved it.  This movie is released in 2001. The biggest strength of the movie is music and casting. Harish is the music composer of this film. The main charactor is Sakthi who is unemployed. It was a dual narrative concept movie. This movie shows how life changes if we miss a second of our life.    </p>

<h3>Anbe Sivam</h3>
<p>This  feel good movie shows the uncertainty of human lifes and it has wonderful screenplay. The story revolves around two charactors Anbarasu and nallasivam. AnbeSivam means loves is god (Hindu god sivam). It's end with a Concept of "Everyone is god for someone's life".</p>

<h3>Rhythm</h3>
<p>This movie has a beautiful story and music. This album is all time best of ARR. It has five songs which potrays the five elements of world and My favorite song from this album is "Thaniya". This song is about land and it compares land's patience with girl. </p>
